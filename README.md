# WiParser

**WiParser** is a modern parser combinator written from scratch in plain C++ 17. It is intended to provide a simple API that can be easily extended.

This repository was contributed by [**Valentin-Ioan VintilÄƒ**](https://www.v-vintila.com) and it is provided under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). For more info about the author, check out his [personal website](https://www.v-vintila.com) or his [other projects](https://www.github.com/w1bb).

## Usage

The repository contains an example [**Makefile**](./Makefile) that compiles the [test.cpp](./test.cpp) file. You can thus extract the required (generic) compilation process.

Simply run `make` and a new file, `./test`, should be created.

### Examples

A few examples should be provided in the [test.cpp](./test.cpp) file. These should give the programmer a good understanding of the basics, without reading any documentation.

## The API

The rich API provided by the current version of the project, **1.0.1b**, will be explained in the following paragraphs
